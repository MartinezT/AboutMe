    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p> I enjoy taking on new challenges to see where it can take me. Always find time to hone my skills if not improve where i am the weakest. Love to get peer feedback, cause without understanding what I did incorrectly there is no way you can grow and teach
    others. </p>
    <p> I find that having a positive outlook on life and a drive to learn. Is what's important to exist.
